# aesthetic-loginpage
I'm kinda bored and experimenting with designing a login page. The only issue I'm facing is that the words between 'Remember Me' and 'Forgot Password' are way too close. If you happen to know how to fix it, I'd be really glad to have your input and maybe even let you take a shot at editing it.

Just to let you know, the code I uploaded earlier is following a tutorial I found on the Codehal YouTube channel.
